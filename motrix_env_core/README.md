# Motrix Environment Core

`motrix-env-core` provides the backend-neutral framework APIs used to build reinforcement learning
environments:

- environment base classes and configuration protocols;
- environment registry and registration decorators;
- backend-independent scene configuration and the simulator boundary (`motrix_env_core.sim`);
- NumPy environment runtime and rendering;
- framework-level math and reward utilities.

It intentionally contains no built-in tasks, robot models, meshes, textures, or motion data, and no
simulator: importing `motrix_env_core` never imports MotrixSim or MuJoCo. Install `motrix-envs` when
the built-in MotrixLab environments are required.

```python
from motrix_env_core import EnvCfg, SceneCfg, configclass, registry
```

Environment implementation packages register themselves by importing their configuration and
environment modules. The framework does not discover or import any concrete environment package.

## Simulator backends

Simulator bindings live in their own distributions and register through the
`motrix_env.sim_backends` entry-point group:

- [`motrix-env-motrixsim`](../motrix_env_motrixsim) — the MotrixSim backend (live simulation,
  rendering, and the torch-tensor frontend); registered as the default simulator;
- [`motrix-env-mujoco`](../motrix_env_mujoco) — a compile-only MuJoCo backend that lowers
  `SceneCfg` into `mujoco.MjModel` (sim2sim, preview, conversion tools).

Installing a backend package registers it; the registry discovers entry points lazily on first use
and never imports a native simulator until a backend is actually constructed.

Compile-only consumers (viewers, converters, previews) import the backend's scene compiler directly,
for example `from motrix_env_mujoco.compiler import MuJoCoSceneCompiler`.

Requesting a backend whose package is not installed fails loudly with an installation hint, and the
other registered backends remain usable.
